## Chat

## Wordgame
A family classic for long car rides. Each person comes up with a noun that starts with the last letter of the word that came before them. 
The game stops when people can't think of words that have not been said in a round or they keep coming up with words that have already been used.

## Note on naming
There seems to be more information about [shiritori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori) than the English equivalent of word chain. The Russian equivalent is just called words, or "a game of words" (as if there is only one). I bothered to look into this after naming this project "wordgame", hence the sucky attempt at translation. Interestingly, this game is common accross cultures with some variations such as: replacing any noun with the verses of Bollywood songs (in India, Pakistan, and Nepal) or with the Romanian variant of using the last two letters for the next word. Adding functionality to filter words by theme (food, places, etc) or adding functionality for the Romanian variant (in English, of course) would be interesting additions.
